## Welcome to **Akeoott-Projects**  
In this "organization", me and my friends (aka contributors)<br>
work on medium sized projects like `GitHub-Activity-Fetcher`<br>
or my first library called `akeoott_logging_config`,<br>
which YOU can pip install right now!

> [!NOTE]
> I'm open to people joining â€” even people not very experienced in coding!<br>
> Main language here is **Python**.

If you want to contact me,<br>
go on my GitHub user profile and read the [README](https://github.com/Akeoott/Akeoott/blob/main/README.md)

> I `Akeoott`, am the owner of this org.<br>
> I `Akeoott`, outside of coding go by the user name of `akeoot`.<br>
> Just call me `Ame` as its always my display name.<br>
