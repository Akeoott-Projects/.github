# Welcome to **Akeoottt**  
In this "organization", me and my friends (aka contributors)<br>
work on ~~tiny~~ medium sized projects like `GitHub-Activity-Fetcher`<br>
or my first library called `akeoott-logging-config`,<br>
which YOU can pip install right now!

> [!NOTE]
> I'm open to people joining â€” even people not very experienced in coding!<br>
> Main language here is **Python**.

This org belongs to [**Akeoott**](https://github.com/Akeoott)
